"High School Notebook" was an idea I came up with while at my local Walgreens buying a notepad to jot my ideas down in.  I walked into the "School Supplies" section and picked up a green spiral notebook.  I was instantly reminded of drawing and writing all over the covers of mine in high school, everyone did, and I hope the kids today still do!

This project takes a layers based approach to generating the final images.  Each attribute, whether it be the stickers, notebook cover, or doodles are each individual layers with rarity percentages set for each layer to determine how often it should show up.  Each layer was pre-positioned on the canvas prior to compiling to ensure proper alignment, however they can be adjusted at code level by specifying x,y coordinates.
